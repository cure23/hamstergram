# 🐹 Hamstergram

Welcome to **Hamstergram** – a simplified version of Instagram, but just for hamsters! 🧀📸

This project is a fun way to practice your frontend skills using JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and working with external data (JSON files).

## 💡 What You'll Build

By the end of this project, you'll have a working hamster-themed feed that displays posts with:

- Hamster profile pictures and names
- Cute post images
- A like button that toggles ❤️ and updates the like count
- Descriptions of each post

All powered by dynamic JSON data!
